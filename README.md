# Pico-286 Project

The Pico-286 project is an endeavor to emulate a classic PC system, reminiscent of late 80s and early 90s computers, on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040/RP2350 microcontroller). It aims to provide a lightweight and educational platform for experiencing retro computing and understanding low-level system emulation.

## Key Features

*   **8086/8088/80186/286 CPU Emulation:** At its core, the project emulates an Intel cpu up to 286 family.
*   **Cross-platform:** Can be built for Raspberry Pi Pico and Windows.
*   **Retro Peripheral Emulation:** Includes support for common peripherals from the era.
*   **Text and Graphics Modes:** Supports various display modes common in early PCs.
*   **Sound Emulation:** Recreates sound capabilities of classic sound cards.
*   **Designed for Raspberry Pi Pico:** Optimized for the RP2040/RP2350 with minimal external components.

## Supported Hardware Emulations

### CPU Emulation
*   Intel 8086/8088/80186/286 processor family

### Sound Card Emulations
*   **Adlib / Sound Blaster (OPL2 FM Synthesis):** High-quality emulation of the Yamaha OPL2 chipset for classic FM music and sound effects.
*   **Sound Blaster (Digital Audio):** Support for Sound Blaster's digital sound capabilities, including DMA-based playback.
*   **MPU-401 (MIDI Interface with General MIDI Synthesizer):** Provides a MIDI interface and includes an integrated General MIDI (GM) software synthesizer, allowing playback of GM scores without external MIDI hardware. This is a key feature for many later DOS games.
*   **Tandy 3-voice / PCjr (SN76489 PSG):** Emulation of the Texas Instruments SN76489 Programmable Sound Generator.
*   **Creative Music System / Game Blaster (CMS/GameBlaster):** Emulation of the dual Philips SAA1099 based sound card.

### Graphics Card Emulations

#### CGA (Color Graphics Adapter)
The CGA emulation provides authentic IBM Color Graphics Adapter functionality, supporting the classic early PC graphics modes:

**Text Modes:**
*   80×25 character text mode with 16 foreground and 8 background colors
*   40×25 character text mode with full color support

**Graphics Modes:**
*   **320×200×4 Colors:** Standard CGA graphics mode with selectable color palettes
    - Palette 0: Black, Green, Red, Brown/Yellow
    - Palette 1: Black, Cyan, Magenta, White
    - High/Low intensity variants for different color brightness
*   **640×200×2 Colors:** High-resolution monochrome mode (typically black and white)

**Special Features:**
*   **Composite Color Mode (160×200×16):** Emulates the artifact colors produced by CGA when connected to composite monitors, creating additional color combinations through NTSC color bleeding effects
*   Authentic CGA color palette reproduction
*   Support for both RGB and composite monitor output characteristics

#### TGA (Tandy Graphics Adapter)
The Tandy Graphics Adapter emulation recreates the enhanced graphics capabilities of Tandy 1000 series computers:

**Enhanced Graphics Modes:**
*   **160×200×16 Colors:** Low-resolution mode with full 16-color palette
*   **320×200×16 Colors:** Medium-resolution mode with 16 simultaneous colors from a larger palette
*   **640×200×16 Colors:** High-resolution mode with 16-color support

**Features:**
*   Enhanced color palette with more vibrant colors compared to CGA
*   Better color reproduction and smoother gradients
*   Backward compatibility with CGA modes
*   Support for Tandy-specific software and games

#### VGA (Video Graphics Array)
The VGA emulation provides comprehensive Video Graphics Array support with multiple advanced modes:

**Standard VGA Modes:**
*   **320×200×256 Colors:** Mode 13h - the famous "Mode X" used by many DOS games
*   **640×480×16 Colors:** Standard VGA high-resolution mode
*   **720×480×16 Colors:** Extended VGA mode
*   **Text modes:** 80×25 and 80×50 with enhanced character sets

**Advanced Features:**
*   **320×200×256×4 (Mode X variant):** Optimized planar mode for faster rendering
*   Full VGA register compatibility for software that directly programs VGA hardware
*   256-color palette support with 18-bit color depth (262,144 possible colors)
*   VGA-compatible text modes with enhanced fonts and character attributes
*   Hardware cursor support with blinking capability

**Color Support:**
*   18-bit color depth allowing selection from 262,144 colors
*   256 simultaneous colors in graphics modes
*   Accurate VGA palette reproduction
*   Support for palette animation and color cycling effects

**Technical Implementation:**
*   Authentic VGA timing and refresh rates
*   Compatible with VGA BIOS calls and direct register programming
*   Support for both text and graphics mode switching
*   Hardware-accelerated rendering optimized for RP2040/RP2350 architecture


## Hardware Configuration

The Pico-286 emulator is designed to run on Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) based hardware.

### Supported Components
*   PS/2 keyboard and mouse
*   SD card for storage
*   VGA and HDMI for video output
*   Audio output
*   NES gamepad

### Minimal Configuration
*   Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
*   External PSRAM chip (minimum 8MB recommended for broader compatibility) connected via SPI.

### Recommended Configuration for Maximum Performance
*   Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)
*   QSPI PSRAM for faster memory access.

### Development Platform
*   This project primarily uses the [MURMULATOR dev board](https://murmulator.ru) as its hardware base. This board provides an RP2040, PSRAM, and various peripherals suitable for the emulator's development and testing.
