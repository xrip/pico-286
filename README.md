## 💾 Floppy and Hard Disks

The emulator supports up to two floppy disk drives (A: and B:) and up to two hard disk drives (C: and D:). Disk images are stored on the SD card.

The emulator expects the following file paths and names for the disk images:

*   **Floppy Drive 0 (A:):** `\\XT\\fdd0.img`
*   **Floppy Drive 1 (B:):** `\\XT\\fdd1.img`
*   **Hard Drive 0 (C:):** `\\XT\\hdd.img`
*   **Hard Drive 1 (D:):** `\\XT\\hdd2.img`

**Important Notes:**

*   The disk type (floppy or hard disk) is determined by the drive number it is assigned to in the emulator, not by the filename itself.
*   The emulator automatically determines the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors) based on the size of the image file. Ensure your disk images have standard sizes for floppy disks (e.g., 360KB, 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB) for proper detection. For hard disks, the geometry is calculated based on a standard CHS (Cylinder/Head/Sector) layout.

## 🗄️ Host Filesystem Passthrough (Host Builds Only)

For host builds (Windows/Linux), the emulator supports direct passthrough to the host's filesystem, which simplifies transferring and accessing files.

*   **Drive `E:`:** The directory named `hostfs` in the root of the project is automatically mapped to drive `E:` inside the emulator.
*   **Usage:** You can place any files or subdirectories inside the `hostfs` folder, and they will be immediately accessible from the emulated DOS environment. For example, `hostfs/mygame/game.exe` on your host machine will be available as `E:\MYGAME\GAME.EXE` in DOS.
*   **Configuration:** This feature is enabled by default on host builds. You can disable it by setting the CMake option `-DENABLE_HOSTFS=OFF` during configuration.

3. **The Pico will automatically reboot** and start running the emulator

### 💾 Setting up Disk Images

#### For Raspberry Pi Pico builds:
Create the required directory structure on your SD card:
```
SD Card Root/
└── XT/
    ├── fdd0.img    # Floppy Drive A:
    ├── fdd1.img    # Floppy Drive B: (optional)
    ├── hdd.img     # Hard Drive C:
    └── hdd2.img    # Hard Drive D: (optional)
```

#### For Linux/Windows host builds:
Place disk images in the project root directory:
```bash
# From your project directory (pc/)
# Place disk images directly in the root:
cp your-boot-disk.img fdd0.img     # Floppy Drive A:
cp your-floppy2.img fdd1.img       # Floppy Drive B: (optional)  
cp your-harddisk.img hdd.img       # Hard Drive C:
cp your-harddisk2.img hdd2.img     # Hard Drive D: (optional)

# Run from build directory
cd build
../bin/host/Release/286   # Linux
# or ../bin/host/Release/286.exe   # Windows
```

**Supported disk image sizes:**
*   **Floppy disks:** 360KB, 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB
*   **Hard disks:** Any size (geometry calculated automatically)

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "display/audio option required":**
- Ensure exactly one `ENABLE_*` option is set for both display and audio

**Linux build fails with "X11 not found":**
- Install X11 development headers: `sudo apt install libx11-dev`
- On other distributions: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel` (Fedora) or `sudo pacman -S libx11` (Arch)

**Host build shows "DISK: ERROR: cannot open disk file":**
- Ensure disk images are in the project root directory (not build directory)
- Check file permissions: `chmod 644 *.img`
- Verify disk images exist: `ls -la *.img`

**Linux emulator window appears but shows black screen:**
- Ensure you have a bootable disk image in `fdd0.img`
- Check disk image format is valid DOS/PC format
- Try running from terminal to see debug messages

**Out of memory errors on RP2040:**
- Try enabling virtual memory: `-DTOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY_KBS=512`
- Use smaller disk images
- Disable unused emulation features

**HDMI not working:**
- Ensure CPU frequency is set to 378MHz (automatic with `ENABLE_HDMI=ON`)
- Check HDMI cable and display compatibility
