# Host Filesystem Passthrough Directory

This directory is mapped to drive `E:` inside the emulator when running on a host machine (Windows/Linux).

You can place files and directories here to make them accessible from within the emulated DOS environment. For example, a file placed here as `hello.txt` can be accessed in DOS as `E:\HELLO.TXT`.
